Pqcoin is a community-driven cryptocurrency. The Pqcoin Core software allows anyone to operate a node in the Pqcoin blockchain networks and uses the Scrypt hashing method and DOUBLE-SHA256 hashing method for Multi-Parent Chain Auxiliary Proof-of-Work Consensus Algorithm. It is adapted from Bitcoin Core and other cryptocurrencies.
